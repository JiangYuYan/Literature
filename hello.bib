	 # Grasp contents(1h)
	
	
	- What：except proof , including figures，diagrams，graphs(axes properly
	labeled? error bars?)
	
	- How：jot down the key points，make comments in the margins, note down
	terms that didn’t understand ,  mark relevant unread reference
	
	
	Gool: summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence
	
	
	 # understand deeply(several hours)
	
	
	- attention to detail
	
	- identify and challenge every assumption
	
	- how I would present a  particular idea
	
	- jot down ideas for future work
	
	
	Gool: reconstruct the entire structure, identify its strong and weak
	points.
